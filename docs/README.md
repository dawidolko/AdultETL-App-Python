This section provides an insight into how the application integrates data processing, statistical analysis, and machine learning to analyze both the UCI Adult and Chronic Kidney Disease datasets.

- **System Architecture:**  
  A detailed description of the project's modular design, covering:

  - Data extraction from CSV files.
  - Data transformation modules for cleaning, normalization, and encoding.
  - Statistical and machine learning functionalities integrated within the application.
  - The integration of the GUI built with PySimpleGUI and how it facilitates ease of use for users.

- **Modules Overview:**  
  An explanation of each module (data extraction, transformation, statistical analysis, machine learning, and utility functions), detailing how they interact and contribute to the overall functionality of the application.

- **Usage Guidelines:**  
  Step-by-step instructions on how to install, configure, and run the application. This section includes:

  - Dependency management and setup procedures.
  - How to use the GUI to load datasets, perform data processing tasks, and visualize results.
  - Running machine learning models and viewing the outputs.

- **Technologies and Tools:**  
  Information about the key libraries and tools used in the project (e.g., PySimpleGUI for GUI development, pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, matplotlib for visualization). Any necessary configuration details and versions of libraries used will also be listed.

## description_problems.docx

This file focuses on the challenges addressed by the DataFusion-App-Python project and outlines the problematics related to both the UCI Adult and Chronic Kidney Disease datasets:

- **Dataset Analysis:**  
  A thorough description of the UCI Adult and Chronic Kidney Disease datasets, including:

  - **UCI Adult Dataset:**
    - The mix of continuous (e.g., `age`, `education-num`, `capital-gain`, `hours-per-week`) and categorical variables (e.g., `workclass`, `education`, `occupation`).
    - Common data issues such as missing values (e.g., represented by “?”), inconsistent formatting, and outliers.
  - **UCI Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset:**
    - The mix of continuous medical features (e.g., `blood-pressure`, `specific-gravity`, `albumin`) and the target variable (`class`: 'ckd' or 'notckd').
    - Missing data and its impact on prediction accuracy.

- **Data Processing Challenges:**  
  An overview of the key challenges in preparing the data for analysis:

  - Handling missing data in both datasets and the strategies used for imputation or removal.
  - Normalization and standardization of numerical features, especially in datasets with varied scales.
  - Transformation of categorical data through encoding methods (One-Hot, Binary Encoding, and Target Encoding).
  - Feature engineering, including the creation of new features to enhance model performance.
  - Data extraction and manipulation for specific analysis or subsets of data.

- **ETL Pipeline Considerations:**  
  A discussion on the design and implementation challenges of building a robust ETL pipeline:

  - Efficient extraction of data from CSV files.
  - Transforming raw data by cleaning, normalizing, and encoding.
  - The importance of data integrity during the transformation process.
  - Loading the processed data into a suitable format for analysis or machine learning models.

- **Machine Learning and Analysis Tasks:**  
  An outline of the machine learning challenges and tasks targeted by the project:
  - **UCI Adult Dataset:**
    - Predicting income levels (binary classification: >50K or <=50K) using various machine learning algorithms.
    - Analyzing correlations between features to understand how different demographic factors affect income.
    - Implementing clustering techniques like K-Means to uncover hidden patterns in the data.
  - **UCI Chronic Kidney Disease Dataset:**
    - Diagnosing chronic kidney disease based on medical indicators using classification models.
    - Identifying relationships between medical features using correlation analysis and association rule mining.

This structured documentation is designed to help both developers and users understand the design decisions, challenges, and solutions implemented within the DataFusion-App-Python project. It provides valuable insights into how the application was built and offers a detailed exploration of the datasets and machine learning tasks addressed.
