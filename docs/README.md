# /docs Folder Structure

The `/docs` folder is dedicated to providing clear and comprehensive documentation for the adultETL project. It contains two essential files:

## documentation.md

This file serves as the complete guide to the adultETL project. It includes:

- **Introduction:**  
  An overview of the project, its objectives, and the key functionalities implemented in the ETL pipeline.

- **System Architecture:**  
  A detailed description of the project's modular design, covering:

  - The ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform, Load) and its components.
  - Data processing modules such as normalization, standardization, and feature engineering.
  - The integration of the GUI built with Python libraries like PySimpleGUI.

- **Modules Overview:**  
  An explanation of each module (extraction, transformation, loading, processing, and utilities) and how they work together.

- **Usage Guidelines:**  
  Step-by-step instructions on how to install, configure, and run the application, including dependency management and setup procedures.

- **Technologies and Tools:**  
  Information about the key libraries and tools used (e.g., pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization) along with any relevant configuration details.

## description_problems.md

This file focuses on the challenges addressed by the adultETL project and outlines the problematics related to the UCI Adult dataset:

- **Dataset Analysis:**  
  A thorough description of the UCI Adult dataset, including:

  - The mix of continuous (e.g., `age`, `education-num`, `capital-gain`, `hours-per-week`) and categorical variables (e.g., `workclass`, `education`, `occupation`).
  - Common data issues such as missing values (e.g., represented by “?”) and outliers.

- **Data Processing Challenges:**  
  An overview of the key challenges in data preparation:

  - Handling and imputing missing data.
  - Normalization and standardization of numerical features.
  - Transforming categorical data through encoding and feature engineering.
  - Extracting specific data subsets based on user-defined criteria.

- **ETL Pipeline Considerations:**  
  A discussion on the design and implementation challenges of building a robust ETL pipeline, including:

  - Efficient data extraction from CSV files.
  - Complex data transformations and cleaning.
  - Loading processed data into the target data warehouse or storage system.

- **Machine Learning and Analysis Tasks:**  
  An outline of the classification and clustering challenges targeted by the project, such as:
  - Predicting income levels (binary classification) using various algorithms.
  - Uncovering hidden patterns and segmenting the data through clustering techniques.
  - Exploring association rules within the dataset.

This structured documentation is designed to help both developers and users understand the underlying design decisions, challenges, and solutions implemented in the adultETL project.
